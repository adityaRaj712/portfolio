      <p>
        Iâ€™m a software developer focused on crafting engaging, accessible, and user-centric experiences. As a software engineer, I blend technical expertise with a strong design sense to create scalable, efficient, and visually appealing applications.
      </p><br></br>
      <p>My aim is to deliver pixel-perfect user experiences. The excitement of bringing my ideas to life and overcoming new challenges is what I enjoy most about coding. Unlike most developers, I don't drink coffee or tea.</p>
